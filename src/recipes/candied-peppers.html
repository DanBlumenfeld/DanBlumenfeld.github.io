<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 lbs fresh peppers (I used a mix of banana, red Fresno, and serrano)</li>
    <li>⅔ cup apple cider vinegar</li>
    <li>2 cups granulated sugar</li>
    <li>⅔ tsp garlic powder</li>
    <li>⅙ tsp ground turmeric</li>
<li>⅙ tsp celery seed</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Remove and discard stems from peppers, then slice into 1/4" slices. Set pepper slices aside.</li>
	<li>To a large pot, add cider vinegar, white sugar, garlic powder, turmeric, and celery seed and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to about MED LOW and simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
	<li>Raise the heat to about MED HIGH to bring mixture back to a boil. Once boiling, add the pepper slices. Allow to return to a boil, then reduce the heat again (to about MED LOW) and simmer for 4 </li>minutes.
	<li>Transfer the peppers using a slotted spoon to clean glass canning jars, filling jars to within 1/4 inch of the upper rim of the jar.</li>
	<li>Only the syrup should remain in the pot at this point. Increase the heat to bring to a full rolling boil. Boil like that for approximately 6 minutes.</li>
	<li>Ladle the syrup into the jars with the jalapeno slices. If you notice any air pockets, take a clean spoon and insert it into the jar to get rid of the trapped air. Fill jars to within 1/4-1/2" from the upper rim of the jar.</li>
	<li>Wipe the rims of the jars with a damp paper towel, then screw on canning jar lids. Label if desired and refrigerate for at least 1-2 weeks (3-4 weeks for optimal flavor). Candied jalapenos are good for up to 3 months if kept properly refrigerated.</li>
