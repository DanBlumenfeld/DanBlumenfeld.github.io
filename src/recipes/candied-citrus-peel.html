title: Candied Citrus Peel
---
<p>
This is a simple three-step process: blanch, candy, and roll in sugar. 
Depending on the thickness of the peels, the number of times to blanch or duration spent candying in syrup may vary widely.
</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Fresh citrus fruit (grapefruit, orange, lemon, and lime all work, with adjustment to cooking times)</li>
    <li>granulated sugar (lots)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        Carefully remove the peels and cut them into similarly sized pieces, roughly 1/4" thick. 
        I usually halve the fruit and juice them, then use a spoon to remove any remaining pulp or flesh before cutting.
    </li>
	<li>
        Blanch the cut peels in boiling water for 5 minutes 2-5 times, to soften them and remove some of the sharpness. 
        For thin soft peels (e.g. mandarin oranges), I'll blanch twice; for thick peels (e.g. grapefruit), I'll blanch 4 or 5 times. Most fruit are good with 3 times.
    </li>
    <li>
        For candying, make a simple syrup with rough 1:1 proportions of sugar and water, enough to keep the peels well covered. 
        Heat until the sugar dissolves and it's starting to boil.
    </li>
    <li>         
        Add the blanched peels to the syrup and bring to a boil, then simmer for 60-90 minutes, taking more time for thicker peels.
    </li>
    <li>
        After the candying is complete, drain the syrup (reserving it for other purposes such as making cocktails!), 
        then spread the peels out on a baking rack in an even layer, being sure they aren't touching one another. 
        Allow to dry for 1-2 hours, until just slightly tacky to the touch.
    </li>
    <li>
        Roll each piece of peel in sugar, rearranging them on a clean rack afterwards. Allow to dry for at least an hour, if not overnight, before packaging.
    </li>
    <li>
        Store in an airtight container at room temperature, or freeze for later use.
    </li>
