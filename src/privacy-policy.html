description: "The privacy policy"
---
<p><em>According to all the best advice, I should have a privacy policy 
    so that you might feel comfortable that your data is safe in my hands.
    How that relates to a static site such as this one, I'm unsure.</em>
</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Data Collection</h2>
<p>
    This is a static web site. I don't collect, store, or process any personal data from visitors to this site.
</p>
<p>
    Frankly, I don't want to, as then I'd probably start obsessing over page views and 
    clickthroughs and retention time (I can barely <em>spell</em> SEO, for god's sake!), and then I'd start considering how to handle GDPR compliance,
    and I'd suddenly have yet another unpaid job.
</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Your Privacy</h2>
<p>
    Since (as I've mentioned before) I collect no data, I cannot and will not (and heartily despise any desire to):
    <ul>
        <li>Sell, share, or disclose your information to third parties.</li>
        <li>Monitor or track your behavior on this site.</li>
        <li>Store or retain any identifying information about you.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    I'll also point out that there are certainly contextually valid business reasons to engage in (some of) the above behaviors; 
    but I consider it egregious to do so without fully informed consent on the part of the user.&lt;/rant&gt;
</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>
    If I ever suffer some form of personality-altering trauma such that I change my mind,
    or if some megacorporation stuns me into amorality with briefcases full of cash,
    I will update this policy.
</p>
<p>
    The odds of such changes occurring are roughly on par with airborne swine delivering Amazon packages to my front door, but they are technically non-zero. 
    If you care, check back here regularly.
