    This, my personal website, has been under the weather for quite some time. I had set it up using Namecheap-hosted Wordpress many years ago, then let it lie fallow ever since. 
    At some point in the past year or so, the Wordpress instance stopped working, and I didn't even realize it until this month.

    So, it's time to bring the site back to life. This time, I'm broadening my horizons by avoiding any dynamic server-based solutions, 
    and am instead going with static content and old-school hand-crafted HTML/CSS/JS.

    Because I'm not a *complete* masochist, I'm using <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> <del>and Bootstrap</del><small>[Edited to add] A week later, I decided to skip Bootstrap and learn some CSS basics instead.</small>.

<p>
    My front-end implementation and design skills are lacking, to say the least, but at least this will force me to learn something.
