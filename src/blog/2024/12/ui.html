<p>In the first iteration of this reincarnation of my site, I started with a quick-n-dirty Bootstrap theme to get the ball rolling...seemed reasonable, right? 
    A quick way to get started?
</p>
<p>
    Yeah, well...it took roughly 2 hours before I began to realize that implementing anything in Bootstrap before I had at least 
    a passing familiarity with CSS was a bad idea. When I found myself sprinkling the pages with <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code>s and <code>&amp;nbsp;</code>s 
    just to mess with layout, that was a danger sign. Young(er) Dan may well have stubbornly forged ahead, but old(er) wise(r) Dan chose another path.
</p>
<p>
    So, I pulled out all of the CSS and Bootstrap junk I'd dropped in place, and started instead hand-crafting the CSS one step at a time.

<h2>Preliminary cleanup</h2>

<section>
    <h3>Eleventy blocks</h3>
    One of the first things I realized, even before getting to the styling, is that I wanted to be able to override the page title format. I'm happy with the default of <strong>Dan Blumenfeld - {page title}</strong> in most cases, but, as an example, <strong>Dan Blumenfeld - Blog - {post title}</strong> might be better for blog posts.

    This was pleasantly easy to accomplish.
    <ol>
        <li>
            In my base page layout (<code>base.njk</code>), I defined the title as <code>{% raw %}&lt;title&gt;{% block title %}Dan Blumenfeld - {{ title }}{% endblock %}&lt;/title&gt;{% endraw %}</code>, so that whatever title was defined in the front matter of the page being displayed would be used.
        </li>
        <li>
            I created a child layout (<code>blog.njk</code>), with the following content:
            <p>
            <code>{% raw %}
    {% extends "layouts/base.njk" %}

    {% block title %}Dan Blumenfeld - Blog - {{ title }}{% endblock %}
    {% endraw %}</code></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            I specified the child layout in the front matter of my post as so: <code>layout: layouts/blog.njk</code>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        And just like magic, it worked. :-)
    </p>

    <h3>File format choices</h3>
    <p>
        I had started with a mix of Markdown and HTML, as I hadn't yet come across a reason to prefer one over the other. 
        Until I realized that Markdown was going to be converted to HTML anyway, so I'd have more control over the eventual output 
        if I just went to HTML in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
        This triggered a bit of angst because I'd already created quite a few Markdown files which needed to be converted; 
        but, taking steps now to make things more consistent down the road seemed wise.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, to sum up: the gerneral rule is that all layout files are Nunjucks(.njk) and all content files are HTML.
    </p>

    <h3>Semantic markup</h3>
    <p>
        Apparently, in this newfangled world of HTML5, there are more options than just the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag for 
        <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Document_and_website_structure#Enter_HTML5_structural_elements">grouping content</a>. 
        Who knew?!?
    </p>
    <p> So, I went through and made a feeble stab at applying the correct tags.</p>

    <h3> My first question: variables, please?</h3>
    <p>
        After typing the same color and size variables more than twice, I had to ask: how can I define variables or otherwise keep my CSS as DRY as possible?
    </p>
    <p>
        It turns out that I can use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties">CSS Custom Properties</a>. 
        This is a means by which properties can be defined using two dashes (--), so that they operate in the same cascading manner as other CSS entities;
        or they can be defined using the @property at-rule. In both cases, they can then be referenced using an inline <code>var(--custompropname);</code> syntax in the following CSS.
    </p>
    <section>
        <h4>Two-dash declaration</h4>
        <p>Has to be written inside a ruleset. For global access, adding them to the root selector is an easy approach, but they can be declared inside any ruleset.</p>
        <pre>
            :root {
                --secondary-color: #c0ffee;
              }
              
        </pre>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h4>@property at-rule definition</h4>
        <p>More expressive, in theory. I've not really used them yet.</p>
        <pre>
            @property --secondary-color {
                syntax: "<color>";
                inherits: false;
                initial-value: #c0ffee;
              }              
        </pre>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h4>Referencing the custom properties</h4>
        <pre>
            main {
                background-color: var(--secondary-color);
              }              
        </pre>
