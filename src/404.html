    <h3>Next Steps</h3>

        <li>
            I'd suggest searching, but I've not yet implemented local search. Soon, perhaps. Until then, perhaps try your preferred search engine, specifying my domain to limit the search?
        </li>
        <li>
            You can always contact me through one of the options liosted in the footer, if it's particularly important to you.
        </li>
        <li>
            Or, you can treat this as an opportunity to exercise patience and forgiveness; either to me for providing bad links, or to you for mistyping one ;-)
