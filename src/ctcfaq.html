<h1>What is Crush The Commonwealth?</h1>
<p>CtC is an informal race (no fees, no prizes, no support) between Point State Park in downtown Pittsburgh and the Liberty Bell in the heart of Philadelphia.</p>
<p>On even-numbered years, the race starts in Philly; on odd-numbered ones, the start is in Pittsburgh.</p>
<ul>
<li>No support means no outside help and no caches‚Ä¶bring it or buy it along the way.</li>
<li>You have to follow the designated route.</li>
<li>Start when <s>Eric</s> Ron says. Probably 5 AM-ish.</li>
<li>Text/post (using #crushthecommonwealth) when you‚Äôre done.</li>
<li>Honor system: no checkpoints, no controles, no-one verifying anything.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Where are the rulebooks, entry forms, waivers, and all that stuff?</h1>
<p>Uh‚Ä¶perhaps I wasn‚Äôt clear about informal.
For the official scoop, keep an eye on the CTC Website.</p>
<h1>How fit do I have to be to ride this?</h1>
<p>Depends on how fast you wish to go. If you can ride 100 miles, at any speed, without being in utter agony at the end, you can likely finish. If you wish to be competitive, you‚Äôll need to be able to ride roughly 4 back-to-back centuries in less than 10 hours apiece.</p>
<h1>What kind of bike should I ride?</h1>
<p>Whatever works for ya. Fixies, singlespeeds, road bikes, and recumbents have all been ridden on this course. The tandem, tallbike, and unicycle divisional records are as yet unclaimed.</p>
<h1>What‚Äôs the route like?</h1>
<p>Flat, always sunny, and with a nice tailwind the whole way. Except when it‚Äôs not.</p>
<p>You‚Äôve got a mix of surfaces with which to contend. 90 miles of packed limestone on the GAP, paved trail near Philly, typical PA roads across most of the state, and broken-up asphalt on which bomb squads have done practice detonations on the abandoned PA turnpike section.</p>
<p>From a scenery perspective (where scenery == hills), the most scenic section is probably between Somerset and Breezewood, especially the bit from Somerset to Bedford. Near Breezewood and the old turnpike tunnels, there‚Äôs also a long moderate climb up to Cowan‚Äôs Gap, and another long shallow climb near Chambersburg.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre heading eastbound, you‚Äôre good to go once you get a few miles out of Chambersburg, as the rest of the route trends downhill. If you‚Äôre heading westbound, Chambersburg is where the real pain begins‚Ä¶</p>
<h1>What should I bring?</h1>
<p>Depends on whether you‚Äôre camping along the way, staying in motels, etc. At a minimum, be aware that weather you may encounter will range from freezing rain or snow to sunny skies and temps in the 80s; layers are your friend.</p>
<p>If you A) intend to ride outside of daylight hours and/or B) intend to ride the abandoned turnpike, some good lights are strongly recommended.</p>
<p>Also, be aware that there are a few long sections (Breezewood-Chambersburg, Chambersburg-York) where, depending on time of day, there may be nothing in terms of supplies available other than a soda machine outside a closed gas station or something. Carrying extra food and beverage on those legs is highly recommended.</p>
<p><em>UPDATE 04/25/2011</em>: Per Fxdwhl, there is a refueling option just a bit off-route, off the east end of the abandoned turnpike. He says:</p>
<pre><code>there‚Äôs another refueling option i just remembered. just east of the old turnpike tunnels head north up pump station rd and go under the current turnpike to a newish rest stop. just a little off course but given that stretch of route worth the effort. google maps shows it pretty well. open 24 hrs too.
</code></pre>
<p>This is the Sideling Hill Service Plaza on the PA Turnpike. Think ‚Äúwell-stocked convenience store, plus fast food options, plus clean bathrooms.‚Äù Not even a mile off-route, so well worth it if one is short on supplies.</p>
<h1>Is the course marked?</h1>
<p><img src="/assets/images/ctcfaq/PA_Bike_Route_S.png" alt="PA Bike Route S sign" title="PA Bike Route S sign">
Yes, by official signs from the Commonwealth of PA. (At least, the portion of the route between Rockwood and Valley Forge‚Ä¶you‚Äôre on your own when it comes to the trails on either end.)</p>
<p>Most turns are marked with this sign well before, immediately at, and shortly after the turn. That said, these are standard road signs, and may occasionally fall prey to errant snowplows, vandalism, or the wily and elusive Pennsylvanian Steel-toothed Beaver. Note also that there are ‚Äúother signs‚Äù, similar to the above BicyclePA sign, that do not have a route letter, and instead have a picture of something outdoorsy like a kayaker, a mushroom, or some such. I don‚Äôt know what those signs indicate, but they can prove a misleading distraction to a fatigued CtC-er.</p>
<h1>How do I call the sag wagon, if I get tired, or bored, or if my bike breaks?</h1>
<p>Uh‚Ä¶perhaps I wasn‚Äôt clear about informal.
You‚Äôre on your own, chummer.</p>
<h1>Where can I find some really riveting ride reports? I‚Äôm having trouble sleeping‚Ä¶</h1>

<h1>Route Overview</h1>
<p>The CtC course consists primarily of <a href="https://www.dot.state.pa.us/public/pdf/bikes/state_mapS.pdf">PA Bike Route S</a>, bracketed by the <a href="https://schuylkillriver.org/schuylkill-river-trail/">Schuylkill Trail</a> on the Philly end and the <a href="https://gaptrail.org/">Great Allegheny Passage</a>(aka GAP) trail on the Pittsburgh side of things.</p>
<h2>Westbound</h2>
<ol>
<li>Start at the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/tNdD9PaBkPU7cUZp6">Liberty Bell</a></li>
<li>Neutral rollout until <s>Eric</s>someone blows the whistle, sometime after getting onto the Schuylkill Trail.</li>
<li>Stay on the Schuylkill Trail until Phoenixville, then head up the switchback ramp to the left. Make a right out of the parking lot onto PA Bike Route S westbound.
1.‚ö†Ô∏èRoughly 2,000,000 miles after you hop onto Route S, make a left on Pump Station Rd to leave Route S. This will be about 18 miles after the top of the Cowan‚Äôs Gap climb ‚Ä¶if you miss this turn, you can A)visit the PA Turnpike Sideling Hill Travel Plaza and B)climb a couple of damn big extra hills.</li>
<li>In about 1/2 mile, you‚Äôll be able to access the abandoned turnpike to your right. Follow the pike (8 miles, two tunnels, pavement ‚Äòless than smooth‚Äô) until the far end just outside of Breezewood.</li>
<li>Clamber down the goat path to the intersection of Rt 30 and Tannery Road. Make a right on 30 into Breezewood.</li>
<li>Fight your way through Breezewood. After about 3/4 of a mile, you‚Äôll pass a Starbucks on your right‚Ä¶you‚Äôll make the next left on Breezewood Rd (after the I-70 ramp).</li>
<li>Things will be very lumpy between here and Bedford.</li>
<li>From Bedford, you‚Äôve got the biggest climb of the route, coming out of New Baltimore towards Somerset. Don‚Äôt be a hero‚Ä¶you‚Äôve got a couple thousand feet of climbing over the next dozen miles, and the last bit on 31 is the steepest.</li>
<li>Once you‚Äôre in Somerset, it‚Äôs mostly smooth sailing to Rockwood via Water Level Road. Pick up the GAP in Rockwood, and enjoy 90 miles of rail-trail to McKeesport.</li>
<li>In McKeesport, head through town and pick up the Steel Valley Trail portion of the GAP. That'll take you all the way to dahntahn Pittsburgh and <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/hfLse8CK8ADYwM33A">Point State Park</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="http://goo.gl/mTpoG">Here‚Äôs a map that is sort of accurate</a>. Note that it is based on the PA Bike Route maps, which may be slightly outdated. In doubt, follow the signs: Route S is signed amazingly well, usually with three signs placed before, at, and after every turn.</p>

<h3>Westbound Elevation Profile</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/images/ctcfaq/CTCWestboundProfile.png" alt="CtC Westbound Elevation Profile" title="200 miles of gentle climb before the real hills begin"></p>
<h2>Eastbound</h2>
<ol>
<li>Start in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/hfLse8CK8ADYwM33A">Point State Park</a>, likely under the highway overpass, likely in the rain.</li>
<li>Neutral rollout until the start of the GAP.</li>
<li>Stay on the GAP until Rockwood, then make a left off the trail and a right after crossing the creek to pick up Bike Route S eastbound towards Somerset.</li>
<li>In Breezewood, you may optionally (recommended!) take the abandoned turnpike to bypass a couple big honkin‚Äô hills.</li>
<li>Follow 30 through the hell that is Breezewood, possibly with a stop at the Sheetz.</li>
<li>As you‚Äôre leaving town, there will be a badly-marked road to the left: Tannery Road. Hop off Rt 30 onto Tannery and stop. (Do not stop in traffic. (Come to think of it, if I actually have to tell you not to stop in the middle of Route 30 in Breezewood, don‚Äôt do this ride.))</li>
<li>Immediately to your right, there‚Äôs something strongly resembling a goat path. Haul your bike up it to access the abandoned Turnpike segment.</li>
<li>After roughly eight miles of decayed asphalt (including 2 tunnels with NO LIGHT‚Ä¶watch for sleeping cyclists!), make a left on unmarked Pump Station Rd.</li>
<li>After 1/2 mile, bear right on Hess Rd to rejoin Bike Route S. There should be a Route S sign very close to the intersection.</li>
<li>Follow Route S all the way to Valley Forge. Just before crossing 422, make a left into the trailhead parking lot, then follow the switchbacks down the hill to head eastbound towards Philly.</li>
<li>Stay on the trail paralleling the river all the way to the Philly Art Museum.</li>
<li>Fight your way through Philly to the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/tNdD9PaBkPU7cUZp6">Liberty Bell</a> at 5th and Market.</li>
