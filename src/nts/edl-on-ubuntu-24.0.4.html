<p>
    For my Home Assistant installation, I picked up a ThinkSmart View 8" tablet, designed for desktop videoconferencing. 
    There's a <a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/is-this-the-perfect-standalone-tablet-for-ha/658422">custom ROM</a> available for it, 
        which requires a tool called <a href="https://github.com/bkerler/edl">edl</a>. Here's how I got it running.
    </a>
</p>
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/bkerler/edl
cd edl
git submodule update --init --recursive
python3 -m venv edl_venv
source edl_venv/bin/activate
pip3 install .
</pre>
Following the advice found <a href="https://github.com/bkerler/edl/issues/245">here</a>: pull down the code, create a virtual environment, use pip3 instead of setup.py
